# Analysis of Missing Data in the Dataset - Actions Taken



## Key Observations and Actions Taken

1. **Column: 'car'**
   - **Observation**: A significant portion of missing values (12,576 or approximately 99.15% of the dataset).
   - **Action Taken**: Decided to **drop the 'car' column** from the dataset. Given the high volume of missing data, this column is deemed not useful for further analysis.

2. **Columns:** 'CoffeeHouse', 'Restaurant20To50', 'CarryAway', 'RestaurantLessThan20', 'Bar'
   - **Observations**:
     - 'CoffeeHouse': 217 missing values (about 1.71% of the dataset).
     - 'Restaurant20To50': 189 missing values (approximately 1.49%).
     - 'CarryAway': 151 missing values (around 1.19%).
     - 'RestaurantLessThan20': 130 missing values (about 1.02%).
     - 'Bar': 107 missing values (approximately 0.84%).
   - **Action Taken**: For these columns with relatively fewer missing values, I have opted to fill the missing data with a placeholder value **"no answer"**. This approach retains the integrity of the dataset while addressing the issue of missing data.

## Conclusion
By dropping the 'car' column and imputing missing values in other columns with "no answer", the dataset is now more robust and suitable for a comprehensive analysis. These actions help mitigate the impact of missing data on the study's outcomes and ensure a more accurate interpretation of the results.

#  Addressing other  Data Inconsistencies

## Non Numeric Entries in 'age' column
In our dataset, the **'age'** column, which is integral to our analysis, presented a data inconsistency issue. This column is expected to be of numeric type (`int64`), but it contained non-numeric values representing age groups. Specifically, the values **'below21' and '50plus'** were used instead of actual numeric ages. This inconsistency could lead to issues in analyses that require numeric age values.


The initial analysis of the 'age' column with `value_counts()` revealed the following distribution:

- 21: 2653 entries
- 26: 2559 entries
- 31: 2039 entries
- **50plus: 1788 entries**
- 36: 1319 entries
- 41: 1093 entries
- 46: 686 entries
- **below21: 547 entries**

To address this issue, the following replacements were made:

- **'below21' was replaced with '18'**, assuming it to represent the youngest legal age for drivers.
- **'50plus' was replaced with '51'**, as a conservative estimate for ages above 50.

## Initial Analysis of Coupon Distribution and Acceptance Rates

### Distribution of Coupons
[README.md](..%2FREADME.md)
Initially, the 'Coffee House' coupons were the most distributed (3,996 instances), indicating a strong emphasis on this category. This was followed by 'Restaurant(<20)', 'Carry out & Take away', 'Bar', and 'Restaurant(20-50)' in decreasing order of frequency.

### Acceptance Rates of Coupons

<div align="center">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="../images/coupon_count_acceptance1.png" alt="Coupons Acceptance" style="width: 100%;"/>
                <em>Figure: Coupons Acceptance Rate</em>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>


The acceptance rates reveal different trends:

1. **Coffee House**: Despite being the most distributed, the acceptance rate is not proportionally high.
2. **Restaurant(<20) / Carry out & Take away**: Show a higher acceptance rate, indicating a preference for affordable dining options and Take away.
3. **Bar / Restaurant(20-50)**: These categories show lower acceptance rates, but more detailed analysis need to be done.

### Recommendations

- **Focus on High Acceptance Rates**: Consider increasing the distribution of categories like 'Restaurant(<20)'.
- **Targeted Distribution**: Adopt a targeted approach for other categories, focusing on specific customer segments.
- **Evaluate 'Coffee House' Strategy**: Analyze customer segments and preferences for the 'Coffee House' category.

### Disclaimer

This analysis is preliminary and based solely on raw numbers. It is important to note that more nuanced and contextual analysis will follow in subsequent sections. This in-depth examination will consider demographic and situational factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the coupon distribution strategy’s effectiveness across different scenarios.

| {temperature_counts.index[2]}              | {temperature_counts.values[2]}      |


- 80°F: Appears 6528 times, indicating more frequent hot weather days.
- 55°F: Appears 3840 times.
- 30°F: Appears 2316 times.

This distribution highlights that hot weather days (80°F) are more prevalent than mild (55°F) and cold days (30°F) in the dataset.

# Analysis of Bar Coupon Acceptance

The proportion of total observations that chose to accept bar coupons is **{bar_proportion_data[1]:.4}** or  **{bar_proportion_data[1]:.2%}**.
This seems like a bit low, so further analysis defintely needs to be done on bar coupons involving other attributes and factors.
We will be doing this next.

## Analysis of Acceptance Rate of Bar Coupons by Bar Visit Frequency

The comparison of bar coupon acceptance rates based on visit frequency reveals:

1. **High Acceptance Among Frequent Visitors**: A significant acceptance rate of 76.88% among drivers who visit bars more than three times a month. This suggests a strong inclination towards bar-related offers among regular bar-goers.

2. **Lower Acceptance Among Infrequent Visitors**: In contrast, the acceptance rate for drivers visiting bars three or fewer times a month is considerably lower at 37.07%, indicating less interest in bar coupons.



This analysis underscores the importance of consumer behavior understanding in developing effective marketing campaigns, especially in terms of visit frequency.

# Analysis of Acceptance Rate of Bar Coupons

## Section 1: Acceptance Rate by Driver Category

1. **High Acceptance Among Bar Visitors Over 25 Years of Age**: A significant acceptance rate of 69.52% among drivers who visit bars more than once and are older than 25. 

2. **Lower Acceptance Among Younger Visitors**: In contrast, the acceptance rate for drivers visiting bars more than once a month but under the age of 25 is lower at 33.50%, indicating less interest in bar coupons.

## Section 2: Acceptance Rate by Age Group

Intrigued by the results from Section 1, a further analysis was conducted to understand the acceptance rates by specific age groups.

1. **Unexpected Acceptance Among Under-21 Drivers**: Despite being below the legal drinking age in many regions, drivers under the age of 21 show an acceptance rate of 40% for bar coupons. The ethics and legality of targeting this group with bar-related offers are questionable.

2. **Highest Acceptance Among Ages 26-30**: The age group 26-30 shows the highest acceptance rate at 77.51%, indicating a strong interest in bar coupons.

3. **Variable Acceptance Across Other Age Groups**: Other age groups show varied acceptance rates, with ages 21 and 46-50 also demonstrating higher acceptance rates of 68.67% and 75.00%, respectively.

## Analysis of Acceptance Rate of Bar Coupons by Driver Category

The analysis focused on two driver categories based on their bar visit frequency, occupation, and passenger type. The categories are 'Non_Farmer_No_Kids_Freq_Bar' (drivers who visit bars more than once a month, are not in farming, fishing, or forestry occupations, and don't have kids as passengers) and 'Others'.

1. **High Acceptance Among Non-Farmer Drivers Without Kids**: The acceptance rate for the 'Non_Farmer_No_Kids_Freq_Bar' category is notably high, indicating a strong interest in bar coupons among this group. This suggests that frequent bar visitors who are not in certain occupations and don't travel with kids are more likely to accept bar coupons.

2. **Varied Acceptance Among Other Drivers**: The 'Others' category, encompassing all other drivers, showed a different level of acceptance. This group includes a diverse range of drivers, hence the acceptance rate might be influenced by various factors like age, occupation, and passenger type.

# Acceptance Rate Analysis Based on Lifestyle and Demographic Factors

## Overview
This report analyzes the acceptance rates of bar coupons among drivers in a dataset, focusing on the influence of lifestyle and demographic factors such as going to bars, age, presence of kids as passengers, frequenting cheap restaurants, and income level.
<br><br>


<div align="center">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="../images/Lfstyl_Demogphcs_Bar.png" alt="Bar Coupon Acceptance Rates By Lifestyle and Demographics" style="width: 100%;"/>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<br><br>

## Methodology
Three distinct groups of drivers were analyzed based on the following criteria:
1. **Group 1**: Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not kids, and were not widowed.
2. **Group 2**: Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30.
3. **Group 3**: Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and have an income of less than $50K.

Acceptance rates for each group were calculated to understand the impact of these factors.

## Findings

### Acceptance Rates
- **Group 1 Acceptance Rate**: 57.50%
- **Group 2 Acceptance Rate**: 60.06%
- **Group 3 Acceptance Rate**: 58.29%
- **Combined Group Acceptance Rate**: 57.52%

### Analysis
- **Presence of Kids as a Factor**: The slightly lower acceptance rate in Group 1 suggests that having kids as passengers does impact the decision to accept bar coupons, although the effect is not as pronounced as other factors.
- **Age as a Factor**: The highest acceptance rate was observed in Group 2, suggesting a strong correlation between younger age and the likelihood of accepting bar coupons.
- **Income Level**: Group 3 showed a high acceptance rate, indicating that drivers with lower incomes might be more inclined to accept such offers, and this appears to be the most significant factor among the ones analyzed.

## Conclusions
The analysis indicates that while the presence of kids as passengers has an impact on coupon acceptance, age and, more significantly, income level are stronger determinants. This suggests that targeting younger drivers and those with lower incomes could be more effective for promotional strategies involving bar coupons.

## Key Insights

1. **High Acceptance Among Frequent Bar Visitors**:
   - Drivers who visit bars more than three times a month have a significantly higher acceptance rate for bar coupons.
   - **Hypothesis**: This suggests that regular patrons of bars are more receptive to such promotions, possibly due to their established preference for these venues.

2. **Age and Lifestyle Factors**:
   - Younger drivers, particularly those under 30, and drivers over 25 who visit bars, show a high acceptance rate for bar coupons.
   - **Hypothesis**: This indicates that age and associated lifestyle choices significantly influence the likelihood of accepting bar-related offers. Younger drivers might be more inclined towards social outings that include bar visits.

3. **Economic and Dining Preferences**:
   - Drivers who frequent cheaper dining options and have an income of less than $50K also exhibit a higher acceptance rate.
   - **Hypothesis**: This trend could reflect a sensitivity to price and a tendency to seek value in spending, making discount offers like bar coupons more appealing to this group.

4. **Family Status and Social Activities**:
   - Drivers who are not widowed and do not travel with kids are more likely to accept bar coupons.
   - **Hypothesis**: This might suggest that drivers without family constraints (like young children) are more open to social activities like visiting bars, and hence more likely to accept related coupons.

5. **Acceptance Among Under-21 Drivers**:
   - Surprisingly, drivers under the age of 21, who are legally below the drinking age in many regions, show an acceptance rate of 40% for bar coupons.
   - **Hypothesis**: This raises questions about the targeting of marketing efforts and the ethical considerations of promoting bar visits to underage individuals. It also suggests a need for stricter adherence to legal guidelines in marketing practices.

6. **Overall Acceptance Rate Context**:
   - It's important to note that all these detailed acceptance rates fall within the overall 41% acceptance rate for bar coupons.
   - **Hypothesis**: Despite certain categories showing high acceptance rates, they represent a segment of the drivers who are generally open to bar promotions, as indicated by the overall rate.

#### Conclusion

Drivers' decision to accept bar coupons is influenced by a combination of factors including frequency of bar visits, age, economic status, dining preferences, and family situation. The unexpected acceptance of these offers by underage drivers highlights the need for ethical and legal considerations in promotional activities. Understanding these nuanced behaviors can be crucial for businesses in tailoring their marketing and promotional strategies effectively to target the right audience.



# Independent Investigation

Using the bar coupon example as motivation, you are to explore one of the other coupon groups and try to determine the characteristics of passengers who accept the coupons.

#  Coffee House Coupon Analysis

In this report, we explore the Coffee House coupon category to identify factors influencing coupon acceptance. We focus on variables such as time of day and passenger type to understand how they affect acceptance rates. The goal is to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing and improved customer engagement.

<br><br>
# Coffee House Coupon Acceptance Rate

The proportion of total observations that chose to accept Coffee House coupons is **{coffee_proportion_data[1]:.4}** or **{coffee_proportion_data[1]:.2%}**. Interestingly, the acceptance rate is nearly 50-50, indicating a balanced distribution between those who accept and those who do not accept these coupons. This equal split necessitates a deeper dive into the data to understand the underlying factors influencing these decisions.

We will be conducting more analyses on Coffee House coupons next to uncover these influencing factors and patterns.

# Analysis of Coffee House Coupon Acceptance: Alone vs Others

In this section of our study, we explored the acceptance rates of Coffee House coupons among two categories of drivers: those driving alone and those accompanied by others. We hypothesized that drivers who were alone would be more likely to accept the coupons than those with companions.

## Expectations and Methodology

Our expectation was based on the premise that drivers driving alone might be more inclined to accept offers, perhaps due to the lack of influence from passengers. To examine this hypothesis, we adopted a two-fold approach in our analysis:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: We commenced by examining the frequency of drivers driving alone versus those with others, to get an understanding of the sample data distribution.
2. **Acceptance/Rejection Rates**: Subsequently, we compared the acceptance and rejection rates of the coupons for both groups, using a plot for a visual representation of these differences.



<div align="center">
    <img src="../images/coffee_coupon_alone_acceptance.png" alt="Coffee Coupons Acceptance" style="width: 80%;"/>
    <br>
    <em>Figure: Coffee Coupons Acceptance Rate for Alone vs Others</em>
</div>

## Insights from the Plot
<br>
Surprisingly, the plot above reveals that the acceptance rate for drivers driving alone was less than 50%. This outcome was unexpected, as our initial hypothesis predicted a higher acceptance rate in this group. The results suggest a contrary trend, indicating that being alone does not necessarily increase the likelihood of coupon acceptance. This finding prompts further investigation into the factors influencing these decisions, which will be the focus of our next section of analysis.


## Further Analysis: Acceptance Rates by Passenger Types and Time of Day

Building on our initial findings, we expanded our analysis to include the acceptance rates of Coffee House coupons across all passenger types. Additionally, we examined the acceptance rates in relation to the time of day. Our underlying assumption was that Coffee Houses would see higher coupon acceptance rates earlier in the day.

### Analysis Overview

1. **Acceptance Rates by Passenger Type**: This analysis aims to provide a broader understanding of coupon acceptance trends across different passenger categories.
2. **Acceptance Rates by Time of Day**: We hypothesized that the time of day significantly impacts the likelihood of coupon acceptance, with a higher rate expected in the morning hours.

### Visual Representation of Findings
<div align="center">

</div>


The figures above provide insightful visualizations of the acceptance patterns. Figure 1 demonstrates that, as expected, the frequency of coupons offered to individuals driving alone is the highest among all passenger types. However, it's notable that the acceptance rate for this group is below 50%. **Figure 2 presents a curious distribution regarding the time of day. Both the frequency of coupon offers and their acceptance rate at 2pm are surprisingly low, diverging from the expected trend.** This anomaly in the data demands more investigation, which we will undertake in the next section of our analysis. 

# Analysis Results: Coffee House Coupon Offers to Solo Travelers

Key findings from our analysis of Coffee House coupon offers to passengers traveling alone include:

- **No Offers at 2 PM**: The dataset shows no coupon offers to solo drivers at 2 PM. This absence is significant, as it might indicate a gap in the coupon distribution strategy.
- **Potential Reasons for Data Absence**:
  - **Missing Data**: The lack of offers at this time could be due to missing data, which might represent an oversight in the data collection process.
  - **User Error During Data Compilation**: There is also a possibility that the absence of data for this time slot results from user error during the data manipulation or compilation stage.
- **Impact on Data Interpretation**: The absence of offers at 2 PM could skew the analytical results. Since this time is typically popular for coffee breaks, not targeting solo drivers during this period might represent a missed opportunity.

<br>

## Expanded Analysis Approach

We analyzed various attributes including 'destination', 'expiration', 'income_bracket', and 'passenger' to understand their impact on coupon acceptance rates. 

## Interesting Findings

Upon reviewing the results, one attribute, in particular, stood out - **'destination'**. We observed that the highest acceptance rate was associated with coupons where the destination was  **"No Urgent Place"**. This intriguing finding led us to delve deeper into this attribute in the subsequent parts of our analysis.



In the following sections, we will focus more specifically on the 'destination' attribute, examining its relationship with other factors in the dataset. We aim to understand why coupons with a non-urgent destination have higher acceptance rates and what implications this might have for marketing strategies and customer behavior understanding.

# Analysis of Coffee House Coupon Offers by Destination

This section of our analysis focuses on the distribution of Coffee House coupon offers by destination, examining the patterns of acceptance and rejection.

## Key Observations

- **Varied Acceptance and Rejection Rates Across Destinations**:
  - **Home**: Out of 928 offers, 336 were accepted (36.2%) and 592 were rejected (63.8%).
  - **No Urgent Place**: This destination saw the highest acceptance rate with 1252 out of 2155 offers accepted (58.1%), while 903 were rejected (41.9%).
  - **Work**: Of the 913 offers, 407 were accepted (44.6%) and 506 were rejected (55.4%).

## Data Analysis Approach

- The data was grouped by 'destination' to calculate the count of offers, along with the numbers of accepted and rejected coupons.
- These figures were then represented in a stacked bar chart, providing a clear visual comparison between acceptance and rejection for each destination.

## Insights on Consumer Preferences

- The analysis reveals how consumer preferences for Coffee House coupons vary based on the destination.
- The destination, 'No Urgent Place' shows significantly higher acceptance rates, suggesting a preference for leisurely visits to coffee houses.
- The bar chart annotations display the acceptance and rejection percentages, offering deeper insights into consumer behavior.

The above visualization underscores the importance of considering the destination in marketing strategies and customer engagement initiatives. By understanding the preference patterns, businesses can tailor their offerings more effectively.


# Expanded Analysis of Coffee House Coupons: Destination and Passenger Type

In our continued analysis of Coffee House coupon data, we have now expanded our focus to include a combination of 'destination' and 'passenger type'. This comprehensive approach has led to some intriguing discoveries.

## Key Findings

- **Dominance of 'No Urgent Place' Across the Board**: Consistently, 'No Urgent Place' emerged as the destination with the highest acceptance rate for Coffee House coupons, regardless of the passenger type. This aligns with the expectation of coffee shop visits being more casual and leisure-oriented.

- **Surprising Trends with Partners**: A notable observation is the high acceptance rate for coupons where 'Home' is the destination, particularly when traveling with a partner. This suggests a preference for enjoying coffee outings close to home when in the company of a significant other.

- **Data Gaps and Surprises**:
  - One of the more surprising aspects of the data was the lack of diversity in destinations when traveling with kids. The only destination recorded in these instances was 'No Urgent Place', indicating either a potential limitation in the data or a genuine trend in consumer behavior.
