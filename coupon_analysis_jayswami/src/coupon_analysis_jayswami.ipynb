    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’.  There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under \\\\$20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants (\\\\$20 - \\\\$50). "

    "   - **Action Taken**: Decided to **drop the 'car' column** from the dataset. Given the high volume of missing data, this column is deemed not useful for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Columns: 'CoffeeHouse', 'Restaurant20To50', 'CarryAway', 'RestaurantLessThan20', 'Bar'**\n",
    "   - **Observations**:\n",
    "     - 'CoffeeHouse': 217 missing values (about 1.71% of the dataset).\n",
    "     - 'Restaurant20To50': 189 missing values (approximately 1.49%).\n",
    "     - 'CarryAway': 151 missing values (around 1.19%).\n",
    "     - 'RestaurantLessThan20': 130 missing values (about 1.02%).\n",
    "     - 'Bar': 107 missing values (approximately 0.84%).\n",
    "   - **Action Taken**: For these columns with relatively fewer missing values, I have opted to fill the missing data with a placeholder value **\"no answer\"**. This approach retains the integrity of the dataset while addressing the issue of missing data.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "Three distinct groups of drivers were analyzed based on the following criteria:\n",
    "1. **Group 1**: Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not kids, and were not widowed.\n",
    "2. **Group 2**: Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30.\n",
    "3. **Group 3**: Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and have an income of less than $50K.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptance rates for each group were calculated to understand the impact of these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acceptance Rates\n",
    "- **Group 1 Acceptance Rate**: 57.50%\n",
    "- **Group 2 Acceptance Rate**: 60.06%\n",
    "- **Group 3 Acceptance Rate**: 58.29%\n",
    "- **Combined Group Acceptance Rate**: 57.52%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "- **Presence of Kids as a Factor**: The slightly lower acceptance rate in Group 1 suggests that having kids as passengers does impact the decision to accept bar coupons, although the effect is not as pronounced as other factors.\n",
    "- **Age as a Factor**: The highest acceptance rate was observed in Group 2, suggesting a strong correlation between younger age and the likelihood of accepting bar coupons.\n",
    "- **Income Level**: Group 3 showed a high acceptance rate, indicating that drivers with lower incomes might be more inclined to accept such offers, and this appears to be the most significant factor among the ones analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The analysis indicates that while the presence of kids as passengers has an impact on coupon acceptance, age and, more significantly, income level are stronger determinants. This suggests that targeting younger drivers and those with lower incomes could be more effective for promotional strategies involving bar coupons.\n",

    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Acceptance Among Frequent Bar Visitors**:\n",
    "   - Drivers who visit bars more than three times a month have a significantly higher acceptance rate for bar coupons.\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: This suggests that regular patrons of bars are more receptive to such promotions, possibly due to their established preference for these venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Age and Lifestyle Factors**:\n",
    "   - Younger drivers, particularly those under 30, and drivers over 25 who visit bars, show a high acceptance rate for bar coupons.\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: This indicates that age and associated lifestyle choices significantly influence the likelihood of accepting bar-related offers. Younger drivers might be more inclined towards social outings that include bar visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Economic and Dining Preferences**:\n",
    "   - Drivers who frequent cheaper dining options and have an income of less than $50K also exhibit a higher acceptance rate.\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: This trend could reflect a sensitivity to price and a tendency to seek value in spending, making discount offers like bar coupons more appealing to this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Family Status and Social Activities**:\n",
    "   - Drivers who are not widowed and do not travel with kids are more likely to accept bar coupons.\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: This might suggest that drivers without family constraints (like young children) are more open to social activities like visiting bars, and hence more likely to accept related coupons.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Acceptance Among Under-21 Drivers**:\n",
    "   - Surprisingly, drivers under the age of 21, who are legally below the drinking age in many regions, show an acceptance rate of 40% for bar coupons.\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: This raises questions about the targeting of marketing efforts and the ethical considerations of promoting bar visits to underage individuals. It also suggests a need for stricter adherence to legal guidelines in marketing practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Overall Acceptance Rate Context**:\n",
    "   - It's important to note that all these detailed acceptance rates fall within the overall 41% acceptance rate for bar coupons.\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Despite certain categories showing high acceptance rates, they represent a segment of the drivers who are generally open to bar promotions, as indicated by the overall rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Drivers' decision to accept bar coupons is influenced by a combination of factors including frequency of bar visits, age, economic status, dining preferences, and family situation. The unexpected acceptance of these offers by underage drivers highlights the need for ethical and legal considerations in promotional activities. Understanding these nuanced behaviors can be crucial for businesses in tailoring their marketing and promotional strategies effectively to target the right audience.\n",

    "- **Surprising Trends with Partners**: A notable observation is the high acceptance rate for coupons where 'Home' is the destination, particularly when traveling with a partner. This suggests a preference for enjoying coffee outings close to home when in the company of a significant other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Gaps and Surprises**:\n",
    "  - One of the more surprising aspects of the data was the lack of diversity in destinations when traveling with kids. The only destination recorded in these instances was 'No Urgent Place', indicating either a potential limitation in the data or a genuine trend in consumer behavior.\n",

    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Balanced Overall Acceptance**: The overall acceptance rate for Coffee House coupons is around 50%, indicating an even consumer interest.\n",
    "2. **Varied Acceptance by Passenger Type**: Solo drivers showed a lower than expected acceptance rate, while those with friends had the highest rate at 59%.\n",
    "3. **Time Slot Analysis**: Popular times like 10 PM and 6 PM show higher acceptance rates, but there were no data points for solo drivers at 2 PM.\n",
    "4. **Destination Impact**: 'No Urgent Place' emerged with the highest acceptance rates, and interestingly, 'Home' was a popular destination when traveling with a partner.\n",
    "5. **Data Gaps and Surprises**: Notably, for passengers with kids, the only destination was 'No Urgent Place', indicating potential data limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",

    "The acceptance of Coffee House coupons by drivers is influenced by several factors, including passenger type, time of day, destination, and potentially missing data points. The analysis highlights the need for comprehensive data collection to accurately gauge consumer behavior and preferences. Understanding these nuanced factors is essential for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively, particularly in targeting the right audience segments."
