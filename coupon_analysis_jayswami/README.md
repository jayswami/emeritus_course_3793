   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset files (e.g., `coupons.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks (`DriverCouponAnalysis_1.ipynb`, `DriverCouponAnalysis_2.ipynb`) containing rich and interactive analysis with extensive reporting and visualization.
- `barplotter/`: Custom `BarPlotter` module for enhanced visualizations.
- `docs/`: Contains `Report.md`, an abbreviated summary report for a quick overview.
- `images/`: Image files used in the project.
- `LICENSE`: License file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

**Running the Notebooks:**
1. Start Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the desired notebook from the browser interface.

**Notebooks Available:**
- [`DriverCouponAnalysis_1.ipynb`](./notebooks/DriverCouponAnalysis_1.ipynb): Includes initial data clean up, assessment, and detailed Bar Coupon Analysis with the final report.
- [`DriverCouponAnalysis_2.ipynb`](./notebooks/DriverCouponAnalysis_2.ipynb): Features detailed Coffee House Coupon Analysis with the final report.

**BarPlotter Module:**
- Located in the `barplotter/` directory, the BarPlotter module is a custom visualization tool designed to enhance your data visualization capabilities. It allows you to create stacked bar plots with ease, making it ideal for showcasing data distributions and comparing multiple categories.

**Documentation:**
- The `docs/` folder contains `Report.md`, an abbreviated summary report. This document provides a quick overview and is ideal for getting started. For a more comprehensive analysis with interactive content and detailed visualizations, refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
