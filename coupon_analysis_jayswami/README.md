## Usage

**Running the Notebooks:**
1. Start Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the desired notebook from the browser interface.

**Notebooks Available:**
- `DriverCouponAnalysis_1.ipynb`: Contains initial data clean up, assessment, and detailed Bar Coupon Analysis with the final report.
- `DriverCouponAnalysis_2.ipynb`: Contains detailed Coffee House Coupon Analysis with the final report.

**BarPlotter Module:**
- Located in the `barplotter/` directory.

The BarPlotter module is a custom visualization tool designed to enhance your data visualization capabilities. It allows you to create stacked bar plots with ease, making it ideal for showcasing data distributions and comparing multiple categories.

This module provides a convenient way to generate visually appealing bar plots, annotate them with acceptance and rejection rates, and customize their appearance. With BarPlotter, you can effectively visualize your data, especially when analyzing coupon data or any other dataset that requires stacked bar plots.

Please note that the module documentation is a work in progress (WIP). We are actively working on providing detailed usage instructions and examples to help you make the most of BarPlotter for your data visualization needs.

Stay tuned for updates to the documentation as we continue to enhance BarPlotter's functionality.
