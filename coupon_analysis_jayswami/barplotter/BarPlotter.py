Module Description:
This module, 'BarPlotter', offers a suite of utility functions specifically tailored for visualizing coupon acceptance 
and rejection data. Utilizing Seaborn, a powerful Python visualization library, it creates stacked bar graphs that 
juxtapose acceptance and rejection rates using percentages, with frequency as the Y-axis.

The core methodology of the module is to provide a comprehensive view of the data. By simultaneously presenting 
acceptance and rejection rates, these visualizations avoid potential misinterpretations that could arise from 
analyzing acceptance rates in isolation. This dual representation ensures a more balanced and insightful analysis, 
reflecting both the volume of offers and the context of rejections.

Key Features:
- Variety of Bar Plot Flavors: The module includes different types of bar plot functions, each designed to represent 
  the data in unique and informative ways. This versatility allows for tailored visualizations suited to specific 
  analytical needs.
- Seaborn Integration: Leveraging Seaborn's advanced plotting capabilities, the module ensures that the visualizations 
  are not only informative but also aesthetically appealing.
- Comprehensive Analysis: By providing tools to visualize data across various dimensions like demographics, time 
  periods, or other categorical variables, 'BarPlotter' facilitates a deeper understanding of coupon acceptance and 
  rejection patterns.

Each function in this module is well-documented, detailing its purpose, inputs, and expected outputs. This 
documentation aims to make the module accessible and easy to use for anyone looking to conduct a detailed analysis 
of coupon data.
